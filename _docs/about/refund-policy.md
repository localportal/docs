At Localportal, we strive to ensure that our users have ample opportunity to explore our services. With our free tier and 30-day trial period for all our plans, we provide access to almost all features, so you can make an informed decision.

If you are not satisfied with your purchase, you can request a full refund within 7 days from the purchase date. To request a refund, please contact us at **[hello@localportal.io](mailto:hello@localportal.io)** with the details of your purchase, including the reason for the refund request. Refunds will be processed through the original payment method used for the purchase.

The free tier and 30-day trial period are designed to allow you to explore and test our services without any commitment. You can upgrade to a paid plan at any time during or after the trial period.

We reserve the right to modify this policy at any time, so please review it occasionally. Changes will take effect immediately upon their posting on the website.
