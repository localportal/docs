## Agreement
    
These Terms of Service (the "Terms" or this “Agreement”) govern your use of the services provided by Localportal, including the Localportal website (the "Site"), the Localportal client software, documentation, and any other software or services associated with Localportal (collectively, the "Localportal Services" or the "Services").

By accessing and using **[localportal.io](http://localserve.io/)** or installing the agent software, you signify your agreement to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms, please refrain from accessing or using the Services. The Localportal Services are available to individuals who are at least 18 years old and to companies that are legally licensed and permitted to conduct business. You affirm that (a) if you are an individual, you are 18 years of age or older, and (b) if you are a company, (i) you are appropriately licensed and legally allowed to conduct business, and (ii) the individual accepting these Terms on your behalf is authorized to do so.

Localportal may modify these Terms at any time, and such modifications will be effective immediately upon posting on the Site. It is your responsibility to review the Terms periodically to ensure awareness of any changes.

This Agreement includes Localportal’s Privacy Policy, which is accessible at [privacy policy](https://localportal.io/docs/company/privacy-policy/). Please review it to understand how we manage personal information.
    

## Account Creation and Responsibility

To use the Service, you must create an account by registering with an email address or using GitHub OAuth or Gmail OAuth (additional authentication options may be available in the future). You must ensure that the information provided during registration is accurate and complete. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information, including your API key generated by Localportal, which grants access to existing machines connected and owned by you. Any unauthorized access must be reported to us at **[hello@localportal.io](mailto:hello@localportal.io)**, and we can mark the account as deactivated. Remember, your account's security is also dependent on the OAuth or email provider used for registration, so be sure to follow best practices in those areas as well.

By creating an account and using the Localportal Services, you agree to subscribe to our marketing newsletter, promotional communications, and occasional product updates. These communications are designed to keep you informed about the latest developments, offers, and news related to Localportal. We respect your privacy and ensure that all our marketing communications adhere to legal standards and provide an easy and straightforward way to opt out or unsubscribe at any time. You can modify your communication preferences or opt out of receiving these communications by following the instructions provided in the emails. Please note that opting out of marketing communications does not affect the receipt of important service-related communications related to your account.
    
## Fees and Payments
    
All Localportal Services are provided on a fee basis. You agree to pay Localportal the fees for each Service you purchase or use, in line with the pricing and payment terms presented to you for that specific Service. You hereby authorize Localportal to charge your credit card or other payment methods on a monthly, annual, or other agreed-upon basis, as set out in the pricing and payment terms, in advance of providing the Services. Services may be interrupted on accounts that are past due, and fees paid by you are non-refundable, except as provided in these Terms or as required by law. Accounts not collectable by Localportal may be handed over to an outside collection agency.

You may cancel your use of the Services at any time as noted on our dashboard. Understand that you will not receive a refund or credit for any pre-paid fees.

Subject to the Terms, certain Localportal Services might be provided to you free of charge, up to specific limits. Usage exceeding these limits requires purchasing additional resources or Services, and Localportal may limit your access or usage until the necessary payment is made. You acknowledge that Localportal may change the specified rates and charges from time to time.

Localportal offers a limited number of lifetime memberships, available on special terms. These memberships are intended for the personal use of the individual associated with the registered email address at the time of purchase and are non-transferable. A lifetime membership entitles you to access the current set of Localportal services and features for the lifetime of the product, without the need for additional payments. Please note, "lifetime" refers to the lifespan of the Localportal service or product, not the lifetime of the purchaser. Be aware that any specific terms and conditions mentioned on the lifetime purchase page will also apply. These terms may not be detailed in this Terms of Service (TOS) but are binding as part of your lifetime membership agreement. Additionally, the lifetime deal is applicable only to the features and services available at the time of purchase. Future enhancements, new features, or additional services introduced after your purchase may not be included in the lifetime deal and may require separate subscriptions or fees. Localportal reserves the right to discontinue, modify, or pivot its services or business model. In such cases, we may not be able to continue providing lifetime access to our services or may limit this access to the services available at the time of your purchase. We will provide reasonable notice to all affected lifetime membership holders in such events.

Localportal is not responsible for any extra bank fees, interest charges, finance charges, overdraft charges, or other fees resulting from charges billed by Localportal. Currency exchange settlements are based on agreements between you and your credit card provider.
    
## User Data Collection and Privacy
    
You must ensure that Localportal is entitled to use any data, information, or material provided, submitted, or otherwise made available by you or on behalf of you to Localportal in the course of using the Localportal Services (“Customer Data”) as needed to provide you with the functionality of the Localportal Services.

Localportal is committed to data privacy and protection. While we have not yet verified our compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for users in the European Economic Area (EEA), we are open to investing time and resources to meet these standards if required by our clients. For detailed information on how we handle and process personal data in compliance with GDPR, please refer to our Data Processing Agreement, located at **[https://localportal.io/docs/company/data-processing-addendum](/docs/company/data-processing-addendum/)**.

You acknowledge and agree that Localportal may use Customer Data to improve your use of the Localportal Services and may use aggregated and anonymized Customer Data to improve the Localportal Services generally. We may also access, preserve, and disclose your account information and other Customer Data if required to do so by any applicable law or if we in good faith believe that such access, preservation, or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with any applicable legal process; (ii) enforce this Agreement; (iii) respond to claims that any Customer Data violates the rights of third parties; (iv) respond to your requests for customer service; or (v) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Localportal, its customers, and/or users, and/or the public. In no event shall Localportal or its designees have any liability or obligation to you in connection with exercising any rights set forth in this Section.

Finally, you must not use the Localportal Services in any way that conflicts with this Agreement or the rights and interests of others.

## Fair Use Policy

Localportal assumes its users will utilize the services fairly and responsibly, hence does not set upfront bandwidth limits. Nonetheless, to safeguard service quality and ensure availability for all, a monthly bandwidth cap of 2GB per user may be imposed on accounts displaying signs of exploitation. This measure aims to prevent system abuse and guarantee fair resource allocation. Localportal reserves the right to monitor bandwidth consumption to uphold this Fair Use Policy. Users observing potential policy breaches are urged to contact hello@localportal.io. Localportal is committed to investigating such reports diligently and taking necessary actions to maintain policy integrity.
