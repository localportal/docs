Localportal is designed to transform your local or cloud computers into fully accessible, highly functional remote desktops, powered by our own custom built pseudo operating system. Discover the endless possibilities and tools at your fingertips, all accessible from the comfort of your browser. 

## 1. Sharing & Collaboration
Localportal streamlines collaboration by enabling secure sharing of compute resources through our pseudo desktops. Users can grant access to their environment by sharing a unique URL or via email, without the need to exchange SSH keys or passwords. Localportal's fine-grained access control ensures that shared resources are only accessible to authorized users. This simplifies collaboration, remote assistance, and showcasing work for technical teams working on projects together.

## 2. Terminal Access
Localportal's terminal app enables you to open and manage multiple terminal instances on your remote machine, providing a seamless command-line experience. You can run scripts, manage files, and monitor processes as if you were working locally. We simplify the access management for your remote desktop. Instead of sharing SSH keys or passwords, you can control who has access to your desktop environment through the user-friendly interface with just a few clicks.

## 3. Remote Filesystem
Localportal's filesystem app provides a user-friendly interface that mirrors your local file management experience, making it easy to navigate, organize, and manage your remote machine's files and directories. With seamless file transfers, you can effortlessly upload files from your local computer to your remote machine or download files from your remote machine to your local computer. Editing files directly within the app is also possible using the built-in text editor.

## 4. Expose Local Ports

- **Versatile Port Exposure**: Make any application running on your remote machine accessible by exposing its port. From web apps to databases, get a public URL to access your services securely.
- **Authentication Options**: Enhance security by enabling authentication for your exposed ports. Choose who gets access to your applications, ensuring that your services remain secure and private.

## 5. Apps & App Store

- **Interactive Computing**: Launch and interact with Jupyter notebooks directly from Localportal. Ideal for data science, research, and educational purposes, this integration provides a powerful tool for executing and sharing live code, visualizations, and text.


## 6. Local Network Mode

- **.local URL Access**: Use Localportal in a local network mode to get a `.local` URL, making your pseudo desktop accessible within your local network without internet access. Perfect for secure, localized operations without the need for external connectivity.
