Installing localportal is a single-command process for all supported operating systems. Just make sure you have **curl** available, and you're good to go. We've got you covered whether you're on Mac, Ubuntu/Debian, or Windows (using WSL with Ubuntu/Debian).

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the installation, ensure that you have the following:
- **curl** command-line tool installed


## Installation

We currently ran and verified localportal on Mac (both Intel & M1), Ubuntu & Debian, and Windows (using WSL with Ubuntu & Debian). Install Localportal by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -L https://localportal.io/install | sh
```

Once the installation is finished, you can verify that localportal is installed correctly by running:

```bash
localportal --version
```

That's it! You now have localportal installed and ready to use on your machine.
