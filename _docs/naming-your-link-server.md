When naming your Link Server, please adhere to the following guidelines to ensure the system processes your Link Server correctly:

1. **Length:** 
   - Your Link Server name should be between 1 and 55 characters long.

2. **Characters:** 
   - You can use alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9) and hyphens (-) in your Link Server name.
   - Your Link Server name cannot start or end with a hyphen.
   - You cannot use consecutive hyphens (--).

3. **Disallowed Endings:** 
   - Your Link Server name cannot end with '-term', '-stat', '-fs' or a hyphen followed by any numbers.

These rules help maintain a clean and user-friendly naming convention, making it easier for everyone to manage and share their Link Servers.
